I am currently pursuing the fifth semester of Computer Engineering from Institute of Engineering and Technology, Indore. During my journey, I've worked on several projects involving Software Development, Algorithms & Data Structures, Game Design & Programming, Android, and Full-Stack Web Development.

## About Me:
I'm a student developer, currently in my 3rd year of Computer Engineering. I put my best into every line of code I write, striving to solve problems through ingenuity and diligence. I'm naturally curious, confidently perseverant and constantly working to improve my skill-set one project at a time. 

I don't define myself by the work I have done, but rather that which I want to do. Challenges drive me, and innovations inspire me. I am an avid programmer, who likes to code things from scratch and enjoy bringing ideas to life. I value diversity, efficient collaboration, and thoughtful interactions. As a lifelong learner, I believe constantly improving my skills and exploring new ideas is indispensable to my craft.

## My skills include:
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Problem Solving
- Android Development
- Game Programming
- Full-stack Web Development
- Python Programming

Additionally, I am also an active competitive programmer, who regularly participates in programming competitions on CodeChef(Rated: 1818) and Hackerrank (6 stars in C++). In my second semester, I achieved 34th rank in an intra-college programming competition which was attended by students of all disciplines and years.
